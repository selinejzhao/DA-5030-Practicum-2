For Problem 2 outstanding concerns/questions/decision points:
Should we do PCA?
Should we dummy code year sold and # of parking spaces
Should we test our model on another dataset for validation?
After analysis should we remove additional outliers?
Should we improve model by adding non-linear relationships between variables?


For Problem 4 outstanding concerns/questions/decision points:
Should we use code samples to show our point?
For the kNN should we normailze data to be accurate or just quickly do it for proof of concept?
